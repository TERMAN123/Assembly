# Fibonacci Sequence in Assembly

## Description of the Project

I was asked to write an assembly language code to generate a Fibonacci Sequence up to n numbers. I had to identify and install the appropriate assembler, compile and run the code. 
Sample Fibonacci Sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34. For this project purpose I used [emu8086.](http://www.emu8086.com/). EMU8086 - MICROPROCESSOR EMULATOR is a free emulator for multiple platforms. It provides its user with the ability to emulate old 8086 processors, which were used in Macintosh and Windows computers from the 1980s and early 1990s. It can emulate a large amount of software that was used on these microprocessors, but a savvy user can also program their own assembly code to run on it. You can watch the sample execution in this following [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jidi5nSnfOk&t=3s) video.

### Description of Fibonacci Series (Numbers)

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where a number is found by adding up the two numbers before it. Starting with 0 and 1, the sequence goes 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so forth. Written as a rule, the expression is xn = xn-1 + xn-2. [LIVESCIENCE](https://www.livescience.com/37470-fibonacci-sequence.html)
