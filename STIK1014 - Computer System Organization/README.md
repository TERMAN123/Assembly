# Fibonacci Sequence in Assembly

## Description of the Project

We we asked to write an assembly language code to generate a Fibonacci Sequence up to n numbers. We had to identify and install the appropriate assembler, compile and run the code. 
Sample Fibonacci Sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34.
